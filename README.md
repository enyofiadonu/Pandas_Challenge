# Pandas_Challenge
This repository contains the completed Jupyter Notebook file for the Pandas_Challenge.
The script analyses the data of a fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli, and generates a report that breaks down the in-game purchasing data into meaning insights.
It finds the total player count, and does an analysis that finds the number of unique items, average purchase price, total number of purchases and total revenue.
It also sorts throught the data by age & gender, and does a purchasing analysis through those filters.
Finally, it sorts through the data to find out the most populuar in-game purchases and the most profitable in-game purchases were.
